# Feature Engineering - Under Development...
---

1. Title + one-sentence tagline

Short, clean, aesthetic.

House Price Prediction (v2)
End-to-end ML pipeline with engineered features, linear models, custom Gradient Descent, and cross-validation.

2. Project Overview

A short paragraph (4–6 lines).
Not the whole story — just enough to understand what the project is.

Example:

This project builds a complete machine learning workflow for predicting California house prices. It includes engineered features, multiple linear regression models (OLS, Ridge, Lasso), a custom Gradient Descent Regressor built from scratch, cross-validation experiments, and a modular training pipeline.

Version 2 focuses on engineering best practices, modularity, and reproducibility.

3. Key Features

Use bullets:

Feature engineering module

OLS / Ridge / Lasso implementations

Custom Gradient Descent model

5-fold cross-validation

Hyperparameter tuning

Full training pipeline script

Five documented Jupyter notebooks

This table quickly sells the project.

4. Project Structure

Code + notebooks overview (short).

5. Installation

Just the commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt

6. How to Run

Example:

Run the full training pipeline 
python3 -m src.train
OR
python -m src.training_pipeline

Open the notebooks

01 — Feature Engineering

02 — Experimental Models

03 — Gradient Descent

04 — Cross-Validation

05 — Training Demo

7. Results Summary

A very short results section:

Best model: Ridge (α=…)

CV R² score: …

Test R² score: …

Do NOT put full tables — those belong in the report. -> Ket takeaways (1-2 bullets)

8. Link to full report

Link to report.md:

For the full technical explanation, see report.md

This is where you point anyone who wants deep detail.

9. Future Work
in the next project combine hyperparameter tuning with cv 🔥

# Feature Engineering - Under Development...

1. Open terminal
2. cd into project
3. Activate venv (“(venv)” appears) -> source venv/bin/activate
4. Open VS Code (code .)
5. Edit Python modules in src/
6. Run training (python -m src.train)
7. Work in notebooks for exploration
8. Install new dependencies if needed
9. Git add → commit → push
10. Deactivate venv when done


python3 -m src.train


in the next project combine hyperparameter tuning with cv 🔥

1. Title + one-sentence tagline

Short, clean, aesthetic.

House Price Prediction (v2)
End-to-end ML pipeline with engineered features, linear models, custom Gradient Descent, and cross-validation.

2. Project Overview

A short paragraph (4–6 lines).
Not the whole story — just enough to understand what the project is.

Example:

This project builds a complete machine learning workflow for predicting California house prices. It includes engineered features, multiple linear regression models (OLS, Ridge, Lasso), a custom Gradient Descent Regressor built from scratch, cross-validation experiments, and a modular training pipeline.

Version 2 focuses on engineering best practices, modularity, and reproducibility.

3. Key Features

Use bullets:

Feature engineering module

OLS / Ridge / Lasso implementations

Custom Gradient Descent model

5-fold cross-validation

Hyperparameter tuning

Full training pipeline script

Five documented Jupyter notebooks

This table quickly sells the project.

4. Project Structure

Code + notebooks overview (short).

5. Installation

Just the commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt

6. How to Run

Example:

Run the full training pipeline
python -m src.training_pipeline

Open the notebooks

01 — Feature Engineering

02 — Experimental Models

03 — Gradient Descent

04 — Cross-Validation

05 — Training Demo

7. Results Summary

A very short results section:

Best model: Ridge (α=…)

CV R² score: …

Test R² score: …

Do NOT put full tables — those belong in the report.
